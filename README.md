## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the tool with the `--help` option to see available commands and options:

```bash
buildmark --help
```

This will display:

```text
Usage: buildmark [options]

Options:
  -v, --version                Display version information
  -?, -h, --help               Display this help message
  --silent                     Suppress console output
  --validate                   Run self-validation
  --results <file>             Write validation results (TRX or JUnit format)
  --log <file>                 Write output to log file
  --build-version <version>    Specify the build version
  --report <file>              Specify the report file name
  --report-depth <depth>       Specify the report markdown depth (default: 1)
  --include-known-issues       Include known issues in the report
```

### Quick Start Examples

**Generate build notes for the current version:**

```bash
buildmark --build-version v1.2.3 --report build-notes.md
```

**Generate build notes with custom markdown depth:**

```bash
buildmark --build-version v1.2.3 --report build-notes.md --report-depth 2
```

**Include known issues in the report:**

```bash
buildmark --build-version v1.2.3 --report build-notes.md --include-known-issues
```

**Run self-validation:**

```bash
buildmark --validate
```

**Run self-validation with test results output:**

```bash
buildmark --validate --results validation-results.trx
```

### Self-Validation Tests

BuildMark includes built-in self-validation tests that verify the tool's functionality without requiring external
repositories or services. These tests use mock data to validate core features and generate test result files in TRX
or JUnit format.

The self-validation suite includes tests that verify:

- Version tag parsing and comparison
- Build information extraction from repositories
- Markdown report generation
- GitHub repository connector functionality
- Mock repository connector functionality

These tests provide evidence of the tool's functionality and are particularly useful for:

- Verifying the installation is working correctly
- Running automated tests in CI/CD pipelines without requiring repository access
- Generating test evidence for compliance and traceability requirements

## Report Format

The generated markdown report includes:

1. **Build Report Header** - Title with version information
2. **Version Information** - Current version, baseline version, and commit details
3. **Changes** - List of non-bug changes implemented in this build
4. **Bugs Fixed** - List of bugs resolved in this build
5. **Known Issues** - Optional list of known issues (when `--include-known-issues` is specified)
6. **Complete Changelog** - Link to the full changelog on GitHub (when available)

Example report structure:

```markdown

### Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/demaconsulting/BuildMark.git
cd BuildMark

# Build the project
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run tests
dotnet test --configuration Release

# Or use the convenience scripts
./build.sh      # Linux/macOS
build.bat       # Windows
```

### Run Locally

./lint.sh       # Linux/macOS
lint.bat        # Windows

# Or run individually
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"   # Markdown linting
npx cspell "**/*.{md,cs}"         # Spell checking
yamllint .                        # YAML linting
dotnet format                     # Code formatting

## CI/CD Pipeline

BuildMark uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### Build Workflow

- **Trigger**: On push to main branch and pull requests
- **Platforms**: Windows and Linux
- **Frameworks**: .NET 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0
- **Steps**:
  1. Code quality checks (markdown lint, spell check, YAML lint)
  2. Build project for all target frameworks
  3. Run self-validation tests
  4. CodeQL security analysis
  5. SonarCloud quality analysis
  6. Generate documentation (requirements, trace matrix, build notes)
  7. Upload artifacts

### Release Workflow

- **Trigger**: On creating a new release tag
- **Steps**:
  1. Build and test on Windows and Linux
  2. Package as NuGet tool package
  3. Publish to NuGet.org
  4. Generate release documentation

### Quality Gates

The CI pipeline enforces several quality gates:

- All tests must pass
- No markdown or spell check errors
- CodeQL security scan must pass
- SonarCloud quality gate must pass
- Requirements traceability must be maintained
