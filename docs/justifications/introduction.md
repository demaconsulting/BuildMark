## Purpose

and documentation workflows.

BuildMark requirements specification. Each requirement justification explains:

- Why the requirement exists

- Software developers working on BuildMark
- Quality assurance teams validating requirements
- Project stakeholders reviewing project scope
- Auditors and compliance reviewers
- Users understanding the tool's design decisions
